            <p>Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
                I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
                But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
                I feel there's nothing I can do, <span class="yeah">yeah</span></p>
            <p>I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
                After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
                I really don't mind what happens now and then
                As long as you'll be my friend at the end</p>
            <p>If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
                If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
                I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
                <span class="kryptonite">Kryptonite</span></p>
            <p>You called me strong, you called me weak
                But still your secrets, I will keep
                You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
                You stumbled in and bumped your head
                If not for me then you'd be dead
                I picked you up and put you back on solid ground</p>

            <p>He spends his nights in California
                Watching the stars on the big screen
                Then he lies awake and he wonders
                "Why can't that be me?"
                'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
                He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now
                But just before he says goodnight
                He looks up with a little smile at me and he says</p>
            <p>If I could be like that
                I would give anything
                Just to live one day, in those shoes
                If I could be like that
                What would I do?
                What would I do?
                <span class="yeah">Yeah</span></p>
            <p>She spends her days up in the north park
                Watching the people as they pass
                And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
                Is that too much to ask?
                With a safe home, and a warm bed
                On a quiet little street
                All she wants is just that something to hold onto
                That's all she needs
                <span class="yeah">Yeah</span></p>

            <p ID="songtitle"><b>Here Without You</b></p>
            <p>A hundred days have made me older
                Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
                A thousand lies have made me colder
                And I don't think I can look at this the same</p>
            <p>But all the miles that separate
                Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face</p>
            <p>I'm here without you, baby
                But you're still on my lonely mind
                I think about you, baby
                And I dream about you all the time</p>
            <p>I'm here without you, baby
                But you're still with me in my dreams
                And tonight it's only you and me, <span class="yeah">yeah</span></p>
